A demo is located here <a href='http://hgsweb.de/floater'>hgsweb.de/floater</a>

A small JavaScript file implementing sticky table headers and 
sticky left columns to give you the freeze pane functionality 
as you find it in EXCEL-Spreadsheets.

For details regarding usage and implementation please see 
files index.html and float.js
